In this project I had to make a few changes to clean up the content of both the index.html and the style.css files.
In the index.html I renamed several div classes to semantic elements to increase readability (for users with disabilities) and help with search engine optimization. 

I also changed the link for "search engine optimization" on the nav bar so that it would move to the referenced id on the webpage; previously no action occured after clicking this broken link.

Thirdly, the title of the webpage was changed from the generic "website" to something more descriptive and professional.

Furthermore, the img tags did not have alt attributes so I added those in as well to aid in accessibility.
